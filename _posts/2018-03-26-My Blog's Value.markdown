It has been 2 years since my last blog post from [AESTE][blog-link], where I worked as an Apprentice Engineer and Intern before. Dr Shawn would forced us to write about daily blog, describe on the task that had been done throughout the week. It was a brilliant move indeed, to make sure that everyone would take the job seriously, because there will always be someone who can monitor your task online **anytime** and **anywhere**... And at some point, I even wrote two blogs in a week, just for fun. From another point of view, it could be said that I am addicted to writing them, and I began to realize the essence of writing blogs.

I still could remember the days where I write my draft blog on my phone even when I am away from the computer, just to make sure that I could publish the weekly blog post on time before 2359 on Sunday! Writing blogs seems to remind me about the time that all the interns would sneak and peek about what the others write about, and what have others learnt about throughout the week (and weekend :wink:). The process of writing blogs, eventually built a firm engineering mindset during the internship. It provides me a clearer view of the internship, or how time was actually being used, which I find very different with current state of life without blogging.

The idea of writing blog had puzzled about in my mind after the internship, but procrastination did the job most of the time. And yet, now it should be the revival of my blog, where I would express my thoughts about some perspective in life, computer, projects and mindset that I came across throughout my life. Blogging can be fun, and it should not be reward driven, as the best reward that blogging provides is being able to continually writing them. Blogging essentially summarizes your point of view regarding something, whether it is teaching, sharing, discussing, praising, complaining and etc. They are a form of giving, which I believe is able to provide motivation, ideas, different perspective about something. It is a form of self reflect about one themselves, learning and knowing themselves more genuinely. I truly believe that, when you give something, you did not lost it, in fact you gained something different in exchange.
